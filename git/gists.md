# Gists

Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets without having to make an entire full fledged repository (even though each gist is in fact a repository).

Secret gists are not posted in the discover page, but they are not private either. They can be seen by anyone who has access to the link.

```
#creates a secret gist, they are secret by default
$ gh gist create example.py

# creates a gist based off what you type into the terminal
$ gh gist create -
Once upon a time in a faraway land,
there was a coder who wanted to share their stories...
