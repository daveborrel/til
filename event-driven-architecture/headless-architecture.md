# Headless Architecture

Headless architecture - This simply means that the frontend (head) is optional and you choose to build it or not.

This allows you to create multiple UIs that simply display the data from this "frontend API"

**Example**

Mobile, IoT, WebApp, Social Media --> FE interface API --> BE API
