# N + 1

A performance issue when the application makes database queries in a loop, instead of making a single query the returns or modifies all the information at once.

Often happens in Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like DJango or Ruby on Rails.

**Django Example**

N + 1

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
def books(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()[:10]
    book_list = [book.title + " by " + book.author.name for book in books]
    return HttpResponse((", ").join(book_list))
```

In this example, we need to do a query to check for each author, of each book, resulting in 11 total queries.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
def books(request):
    books = Book.objects.select_related("author").all()[:10]
    book_list = [book.title + " by " + book.author.name for book in books]
    return HttpResponse((", ").join(book_list))
```

Here we fixed our issue by using `select_related` which joins the tables ahead of time.

**Node Example and MongoDB**

```js
app.get("/books", async (req, res) => {
  const db = client.db("library");
  const books = await db.collection("books").find().limit(10).toArray(); // 1 query
  const bookList = [];

  for (const book of books) {
    const author = await db
      .collection("authors")
      .findOne({ _id: book.authorId }); // N queries
    bookList.push(`${book.title} by ${author.name}`);
  }

  res.send(bookList.join(", "));
});
```

```js
app.get("/books", async (req, res) => {
  const db = client.db("library");

  const books = await db
    .collection("books")
    .aggregate([
      { $limit: 10 },
      {
        $lookup: {
          from: "authors",
          localField: "authorId",
          foreignField: "_id",
          as: "author",
        },
      },
      { $unwind: "$author" },
    ])
    .toArray();

  const bookList = books.map((book) => `${book.title} by ${book.author.name}`);
  res.send(bookList.join(", "));
});
```

We fixed the N + 1 query issue by using `$lookup`.
