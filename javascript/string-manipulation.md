# String Manipulation in JavaScript

You can split a string into an array by its spaces, just like it in python.

```js
const str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const words = str.split(" ");
console.log(words[3]);
// Expected output: "fox"
```

You can also join an array into a string in a similar way

```js
const str = ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"];
ans.join(" ");

//output will be: "blue is sky the"
```
