# SHA-256

Secure hash algorithm with digest size of 256 bits.

**Hash function review**

- Transforms a given string of characters into something scrambled deterministically. Meaning "hello world" will always scramble to "iuhwdiv76" for example.
- Output is of fixed size
- Irreversible

**Unique features of SHA**

- 256 Bit output
- Secure
- Fast

**Real World Uses**

- Antivirus – Checks the SHA-256 hash of word.exe against a database of known hashes. If it doesn’t match, the file may be tampered with or malicious.
- Authentication – The server verifies a user’s token by computing `HMAC-SHA256(username + key)` and checking if it matches the stored value, ensuring integrity and security.
