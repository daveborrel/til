# Load Balancing Algorithms

A load balancer is software or hardware that prevents servers from becoming overloaded.

A load balancing algorithm is the logic used to spread that load across multiple servers.

There are two categories

1. Dynamic Load Balancing - take into account the state of the server
- Least Connection
- Weighted Least Connection
- Weighted Response Time
- Resource Based
2. Static Load Balancing - distributes traffic without any adjustments
- Round Robin
- Weighted Round Robin
- IP Hash
