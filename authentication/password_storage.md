# Password Storage

#### 1. Hashing
- You can store the password by hashing it and turning it into a fingerprint.

#### 2. Salting
- Adding an extra random string before hashing and creating the fingerprint.

#### 3. Stretching
- Hackers might try to crack the code a few times, so they use the hash function multiple times to generate a fingerprint.
